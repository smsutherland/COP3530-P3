specify event type
check boxes for what other kinds of specifications desired
	1. date range (years only)
        bottom value
        top value
    2. time range (measured in seconds) - if I have enough time I may allow for mm:ss format
        bottom value
        top value
    3. average/single (radio buttons so you can only select one) (defaults to single if not specified)
        average 
        single
    4. we could add some stuff about specifying region(s) but I think we should only do that if we've finished everything else and want to polish it more.
choose between AVL tree or standard BST
